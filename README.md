This project presents the random forest machine learning method applied to predict precipitation in a python notebook.  We start by applying the random forest machine learning method without clearing the data, then we remove predictors that are constant at all times and nan values.  

Two predictors that are highly correlated with each other adversely affect the machine learning and one of the predictors must be removed.  The next step i  this project is to perform these tasks and throughly clean the data to improve the prediction.

Then we will apply other robust machine learning methods to see if they can improve the prediction.
